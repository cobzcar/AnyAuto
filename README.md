AnyAuto puts **ordinary phone apps on the Android Auto screen**: a browser, a video app,
Settings, or anything else with a launcher icon. You don't change the apps. AnyAuto runs them
on a car-sized virtual display, draws that display onto the car screen, and sends the car's
taps, drags, flings and pinches back to the app as touches.

It uses [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/), so you don't need root or a computer in the
car. It has no internet permission, no account and no analytics.

## What you need

- An Android phone with Android 10 or newer.
- **Shizuku**, installed and running. On Android 11 and newer it starts on the phone itself.
  On Android 10 it needs a computer after every reboot.
- **[UnknownAuto](https://github.com/GitMag/UnknownAuto)** to install AnyAuto for the car.
  Android Auto runs only car apps that were installed from Google Play, and UnknownAuto
  installs an APK so that it counts as a Play install. The desktop head unit doesn't check
  this, so a plain `adb install` is enough there.

## Install

1. Download **AnyAuto-<version>.apk** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/GitMag/AnyAuto/releases/latest) on the phone.
2. Open UnknownAuto, tap **Load APK or XAPK…**, pick the APK and tap **Install**. For the
   desktop head unit, a normal install is enough.
3. Add AnyAuto to Android Auto's launcher (Android Auto settings → *Customize launcher*).

Or build it yourself with the plain Android SDK tools (no Gradle; build-tools 35 and the
android-35 platform):

```
./build.sh            # build anyauto.apk
./build.sh install    # build, adb install -r, then open it (ANDROID_SERIAL picks the device)
```

The first build downloads the libraries (the Car App Library and the Shizuku API) into
`libs/` and creates a local signing key in `keys/`. An APK you build yourself is signed with
your own key, so it can't update the release APK: uninstall that one first.

## Set up (once)

1. **Start Shizuku.** Follow *Set up Shizuku* in
   [UnknownAuto's README](https://github.com/GitMag/UnknownAuto#set-up-shizuku-once). You
   pair the phone with itself over Wireless debugging, and no computer is needed. Android
   stops Shizuku at every reboot, so you have to start it again after one.
2. **Allow AnyAuto.** Open AnyAuto and tap **Allow** on the Shizuku card, then choose
   **Allow all the time**.
3. **Choose apps.** Tap **Choose apps** at the bottom and tick the apps you want in the car.

AnyAuto's home screen shows a card whenever something still needs doing: Shizuku missing,
stopped or not allowed, or AnyAuto not installed for the car.

## Use

**On the phone:** **Try** next to a chosen app opens it at car size on the phone. It is a
landscape preview with the same display and gesture handling as the car. The rail on the right
has **Close**, **Direct** (raw touches instead of car gestures), **Card** (the size of the
dashboard card), **Keyboard** and **Back**. The ⋮ menu has the settings and **Help**.

**In the car:** open AnyAuto and pick an app from the grid. The app you have open is marked
**Open**. The buttons at the top are **Apps** (back to the grid), **Keyboard** and **Back** (the
app's own Back). For drags, turn on the pan button in the map strip. AnyAuto also works on the
Android Auto dashboard: the app is drawn into the dashboard card.

**YouTube shortcut:** when YouTube is installed, a YouTube tile stays first in the car's apps
grid, whether or not you ticked it in *Choose apps*. Turn it off with ⋮ → **YouTube shortcut in
the car**.

**Poweramp widget:** ⋮ → **Poweramp widget** lists Poweramp's widgets. Pick one and allow AnyAuto
to hold it (Android asks once). The widget then comes first in the car's apps grid and fills the
car screen, with its buttons working by touch.

**Full screen:** the app uses the whole car screen, edge to edge, like Google Maps does (Android
Auto rounds the corners a little). The buttons float over its top corner until they hide by
themselves. To keep them out of the app's way, turn off ⋮ → **Full screen in
the car**; the app then starts below them.

**Typing:** tap a text field and the keyboard opens on the car screen. The **Keyboard** button
opens it for the selected text field, or closes it (it says so when no text field is selected).
To type on the phone instead, choose ⋮ → **Keyboard** → **On the phone**: the phone's screen
then stays on while AnyAuto is on the car screen. The Keyboard button needs Android 11 or newer.

AnyAuto is listed as a navigation app because that is the only Android Auto category that
gets the whole car screen to draw on. It never starts navigation, so Google Maps keeps
directions and "navigate to" requests.

## While an app is on the car screen

- **The phone.** On many phones (Android 14, for example) the car screen runs on its own, and
  AnyAuto leaves the phone alone: lock it, put it away or use it as usual. Where the car screen
  would sleep with the phone (Android 17 on a Pixel, for example), AnyAuto keeps the phone awake
  with its screen off. The power button still puts it to sleep, and the car screen then pauses
  until you tap it. AnyAuto checks which case your phone is. When Android Auto stops showing
  AnyAuto, the phone goes back to how it was (asleep if AnyAuto woke it). If you move between the
  grid, the app and other car screens, AnyAuto waits 8 seconds before it lets go, so the phone
  doesn't keep lighting up.
- **Using the phone at the same time:** turn on ⋮ → **Keep the phone's screen on**. Touching the
  phone moves Android's focus to it, so a keyboard open on the car screen closes.
- **Apps on the car screen skip the phone's lock,** like Android Auto's own apps. Dark doesn't
  mean locked: if the phone was unlocked, it stays unlocked.
- **Some windows show black.** Apps that protect their windows show black on the car screen.
  Examples are banking apps, DRM video (Netflix and other streaming services) and Chrome
  incognito tabs. Non-DRM video, such as YouTube, works.
- **Portrait-only apps** (many games and messaging apps) show upright in a column in the
  middle of the car screen, at full height. The car screen can't turn, so AnyAuto keeps its
  display landscape whatever the app asks for.
- **One car display:** **Try** is unavailable while AnyAuto is on the car screen.

**Drive safely.** AnyAuto doesn't lock anything while the car is moving. Use video and other
distracting apps only when the car is parked. Follow the traffic laws where you drive.

## How it works

```
Android Auto (car screen)                AnyAuto app process              Shizuku process (shell user)
 NavigationTemplate surface ──Surface──▶ MirrorScreen ─▶ Mirror ──AIDL──▶ DisplayService
 onClick/onScroll/onFling/onScale ─────▶ Touch (gestures → MotionEvents) ─▶ inject into the display
                                                                          VirtualDisplay (trusted, public,
                                                                          always unlocked, own focus)
                                                                          └─ any app, started on it
                                                                          PhonePower: phone awake, panel off
 Compositor (GL): the display's frames → the visible part of the car surface
```

- **Shizuku:** only the shell user (or the system) can create a *trusted* virtual display
  that other apps may start on, and inject input into it. scrcpy's `--new-display` works the
  same way. Shizuku runs AnyAuto's `DisplayService` with the shell user's rights, on the phone
  itself.
- **No video encoding:** the car's Surface goes over binder to the Shizuku process, and the
  display draws into it there, so frames are never copied or encoded. An app that is already
  open on the phone moves to the car display.
- **Gestures (`Touch`):** Android Auto doesn't give a navigation app raw touches. It gives a tap
  position, scroll *distances*, a fling velocity and pinch steps, and `Touch` rebuilds touch
  streams from them. A drag starts in the middle of the visible area, first moves past the
  touch slop so no distance is lost, and ends 150 ms after the last step or at the screen edge.
- **Fitting the car screen (`Compositor`):** Android Auto shows only part of a navigation app's
  surface: the dashboard or launcher card, or everything below the action strip. The display
  draws into a texture, and OpenGL draws each frame into the car's stable area. The rest stays
  black. The display is resized to that area, and car coordinates are shifted to match.
- **Keyboard on the car screen:** Android opens a virtual display's keyboard on the phone by
  default. AnyAuto sets the display's keyboard policy to *local*
  (`IWindowManager.setDisplayImePolicy`), like scrcpy's `--display-ime-policy local`. The
  Keyboard button reads the keyboard state through accessibility, connected only for that
  moment, then sends Back or taps the selected text field.
- **The phone's screen (`PhonePower`):** a virtual display sleeps with its display group.
  AnyAuto checks the group after making the display. If it has a group of its own (Android 14,
  for example), only that group is kept awake (a wake lock for that display) and the phone is
  left alone. On Android 17 builds that support desktop mode, every virtual display is put in the
  phone's group. There AnyAuto holds a wake lock and powers off only the phone's own panel
  (`IDisplayManager.requestDisplayPower`), and turns it off again whenever the system turns it
  back on.
